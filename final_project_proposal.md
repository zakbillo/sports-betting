## Tentative Project Title

Beyond the Spread: Analyzing the Demographics of a Gambling Epidemic

## Motivation for Project

Sports gambling has been on the rise in recent years. Whether you are
watching sports, TV with ads, social media content, or even just taking
the subway, you are being exposed in one way or another to sports
betting advertisements. With little regulation and large-scale scandals
surrounding sports betting in recent months, an analysis of the key
demographics of who partakes the most in sports gambling will be
critical in understanding how to create and implement programs to
effectively reduce the burden of gambling addictions that are surely to
be on the rise in the upcoming years. Assessing education & income
status, age, and proximity to a major sports team are among the
demographic factors we want to investigate. Additionally, we may be able
to project the market sizes of sports gambling in states that have yet
to legalize it, such as California.

## Intended Final Products

- Website detailing the market size of sports gambling by state
- Model predicting odds of gambling based on demographics (education &
  income status, age, and proximity to a major sports team)

## Anticipated Data Sources

- [US sports betting revenue](https://rg.org/statistics/us)
- NHANES or Census for demographic data

## Planned Analyses/Visualizations/Coding Challenges

## Planned Timeline

- Scrape data from the betting revenue website
- Compile and clean relevant NHANES demographic data
- Exploratory analyses of
- Create a model that predicts gambling revenue across states, based on
  demographics
