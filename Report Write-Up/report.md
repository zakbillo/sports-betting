## Motivation

**Overview of project goals and overall motivation**

Sports gambling has been on the rise in recent years. Whether you are
watching sports, TV with ads, social media content, or even just taking
the subway, you are being exposed in one way or another to sports
betting advertisements. With little regulation and large-scale scandals
surrounding sports betting in recent months, an analysis of the key
demographics of who partakes the most in sports gambling will be
critical in understanding how to create and implement programs to
effectively reduce the burden of gambling addictions that are surely to
be on the rise in the upcoming years.

Assessing education & income status, age, and proximity to a major
sports team are among the demographic factors we wanted to investigate.
Additionally, we aimed to predict gambling revenue in states that have
yet to legalize it, such as California.

## Initial Questions

We initially wanted to answer whether any demographic characteristics
are associated with higher amounts of sports gambling, such as age, sex,
educations status, income level, and proximity to a major sports team.
We also considered trying to project gambling revenue based on
demographics (education & income status, age, and proximity to a major
sports team), as well as the market sizes of sports gambling in states
that have yet to legalize it, such as California.

As we began to explore data sources and develop an analysis plan, we
found it more feasible to focus on an exploratory data analysis of
gambling revenue by state, as well as demographic characteristics by
state. We further decided to examine and execute a predictive model of
sports gambling revenue in states that have yet to legalize it. The
nature of the data on hand, due to misalignment between gambling revenue
data and available census demographic data per state, informed our
decision to focus on predictive modeling rather than an exploration of
demographic predictors of sports gambling. **KIMIA EDIT THIS TO BE MORE
