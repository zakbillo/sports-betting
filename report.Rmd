## Motivation

Scandals surrounding gambling in sports have reached the national stage in recent months, fueled by a meteoric rise over the last few years that has seemingly gone unchecked by our regulators. Whether you watch sports, TV, streaming, use social media, or take the subway, you've definitely been exposed to sports betting advertisements in one way or another. Our analysis focuses on the demographic factors underlying revenue earned in legal sports betting markets, including education & income status, age, and proximity to a major sports team. We then built a model to project the revenue generated in states with illegal markets and those likely to legalize soon—such as California. The overarching goal is to illustrate how the potential profitability of the sports gambling industry might compromise regulatory oversight. 

## Related Work

As sports fans, we are increasingly concerned about the direction sports media is taking in promoting sports gambling. This interest led to a desire to investigate the market's size and scale to assess the potential of the issue at hand; the recent [NBA gambling case](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/24/nyregion/nba-sports-betting-gambling-scandal.html) particularly inspired us.

## Initial Questions

We initially wanted to determine whether demographic characteristics are associated with greater sports gambling, such as age, sex, education level, income level, and proximity to a major sports team. We also considered projecting gambling revenue based on demographics (education & income status, age, and proximity to a major sports team) over time, as well as the market sizes of sports gambling in states that have yet to legalize it, such as California. 

As we began exploring data sources and developing an analysis plan, we found it more feasible to focus on an exploratory analysis of gambling revenue by state and demographic characteristics. Additionally, we built a predictive model of sports gambling revenue in states that have yet to legalize it to project the full potential market size of sports gambling in the U.S.

Due to the lack of granularity in gambling revenue data, we found it unrealistic to conduct an analysis as detailed as we had initially intended, given the data available. Additionally, for feasibility, we decided to focus on the relationship between the 2024 census demographic data and the gambling revenue data. For these reasons, we found it more worthwhile to focus on predictive modeling rather than an exploration of demographic predictors of sports gambling. 


## Data

**Source, scraping method, cleaning**

Gambling data was obtained from [Research Ground's US sports betting data](https://rg.org/statistics/us). Initial scraping of the website was conducted, but due to dynamic filters for year and state, only the static data, which included 2024 gambling revenue by state and growth figures for 2025, could be pulled using this method. In other years, this data was hidden behind dynamic filters that R could not access with basic scraping tools. Subsequently, the gambling revenue by state and overall U.S revenue growth per month and year were manually pulled in for all other years (2018-2023 for revenue and 2018-2024 for growth). From here, the data were compiled into a master data set for total revenue per state per year and revenue market growth per month and year. States that have not legalized sports betting lack available gambling revenue data and were thus not included in the initial descriptive analysis.

Demographic data were obtained from the 2024 American Community Survey (ACS) using the Census API via the tidycensus R package. Each demographic variable of interest was pulled at the state level using the corresponding ACS table codes. The collected variables included median household income, total population size, percentage of adults with a bachelor’s degree or higher, percentage of residents aged 20–34, percentage of residents living in urban and rural areas, percentage living below the federal poverty line, percentage male, unemployment rate, racial and ethnic composition (percent white, Black, Asian, and Hispanic), median age, broadband internet access, household Gini coefficient, and housing tenure (% renters and % owners).
Because these variables originate from multiple ACS tables with different formats, each dataset was cleaned individually, estimates were extracted and renamed for consistency, and calculated measures (such as percent bachelor’s degree or percent in poverty) were derived where necessary. After cleaning, all demographic datasets were merged into a single comprehensive dataframe using state names as the key identifier. The resulting dataset provides a standardized demographic profile for all U.S. states and Washington, D.C. It serves as the basis for examining differences between legalized and non-legalized gambling states and for developing the predictive model.

## Exploratory analysis

**Visualizations of gambling revenue data**

Preliminary visualizations of the gambling revenue data were created. First, a column chart of total US gambling revenue from 2018 to 2024 was generated, aggregating revenue across all states, showing a steep increase over that period. Then, a column chart of gambling revenue from 2018 to 2024 was built, color-coded by state, highlighting the top 5 states in 2018 (New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Indiana, Arkansas, and Mississippi). An “other states” category, which represents all other states in the U.S., was also coded in. This plot shows that other states that have entered the sector through legalization have significantly altered the market landscape and its size. In 2018, the market was primarily composed of the top 5 states, whereas in 2024, the states that were once major players now account for only a fraction of the overall market. This plot also illustrates a steep increase in overall U.S gambling revenue from 2018 to 2024.

Finally, a visualization was created to show the top 5 states by gambling revenue each year from 2018 to 2024. This plot shows how the top 5 largest state markets have shifted over the years and ranks their overall market share as of 2024. We see that as some states began to legalize sports gambling during this period, such as New York in 2022, they emerged as top gambling revenue players through 2024. New Jersey and Pennsylvania have consistently remained in the top 5 from 2018 to 2024. On the other hand, there has been a steady decline in the ranking of gambling revenue in Mississippi, Rhode Island, and Arkansas from 2018 to 2024. We see a unique trend in Michigan, which was ranked for the first time in 2020, spiked in 2021, and then declined to rank 13th by 2024.

**Visualizations of census demographic data**

Preliminary visualizations of the census demographic data were generated. Two column charts of total population and total gambling revenue in 2024 by state were compared side by side. The plot of the gambling revenue by state showed that arranging states by descending population size did not yield the same pattern for gambling revenue. For example, while New Jersey is the 7th-largest state by population, it is the 3rd-largest in gambling revenue. This suggests that other factors are at play in predicting states' gambling revenue. 

A line chart of the racial makeup of each state in 2024, showing the percentages of white, Black, Asian, and Hispanic people, was also generated, with states arranged in descending order of gambling revenue. Racial distributions vary across states, with no discernible pattern between gambling revenue and the racial makeup of these states. A similar plot of the percentage of the population in poverty and each state's unemployment rate in 2024, ordered by descending gambling revenue, was also created, with no apparent pattern between gambling revenue and the economic measures. 


## Additional analysis

**Predictive modeling of sports gambling revenue**

To estimate potential gambling markets in states without legalized sports betting, a predictive modeling approach was implemented using 2024 state-level gambling revenue and demographic characteristics. After compiling the complete demographic dataset and merging it with observed gambling revenue, a subset of states with legalized sports betting and complete revenue data was used as the training dataset. These states were examples of how demographic and socioeconomic features relate to actual gambling revenue.
Many of these demographic variables were correlated with each other, such as education and income, so ordinary linear regression risked instability and inflated variance in the coefficient estimates. To avoid this, we used the Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO), a penalized regression model. LASSO regression has a penalty that shrinks coefficients toward zero, selecting the strongest predictors and reducing the influence of highly correlated or weakly informative variables. This improves model interpretability, reduces overfitting, and allows for stable predictions. This was also important because the number of predictors was large relative to the number of observations.  

A cross-validated LASSO model was fit using demographic predictors, including total population, median income, educational attainment, young-adult population share, urbanization, and poverty rate. Five-fold cross-validation was used to identify the penalty parameter lambda that minimized prediction error. The selected model was then applied to all U.S. states, including those without legalized sports betting. For each non-legalized state, the model generated an estimated gambling revenue value that reflects its demographic profile relative to states with established gambling markets. Predictions were then summarized, ranked, and compared with the distribution of actual revenue in legalized states. This provided a framework for identifying states with the highest projected gambling markets.

## Discussion

**Findings, expectations, insights**

Our analysis has illustrated a dynamic shift in U.S gambling revenue trends since 2018. The market size grew from \$110 million in 2018 to almost \$14 billion by 2024. As more states are integrated into the market, trends are increasing at a staggering rate. Some of the top 5 states from just a couple of years ago, such as Mississippi and Rhoad Island, are now fading into the background as central states, including New York, have legalized and entered the sector. This sharp increase in the market is easily noticed when consuming sports media today. Ads for sports gambling are ubiquitous on TV networks and have become synonymous with all forms of sports coverage. Understanding and quantifying the size of this market and what it could become is crucial to predicting its long-term effects on gambling-related issues. As central states like California and Texas have yet to legalize, the potential for this market to continue to grow exponentially is very real. Furthermore, our analysis of census data highlighted specific predictors of increased sports gambling, such as a high percentage of low-income populations and a high percentage of young adults (aged 20 to 34), which will help inform targeted interventions to help reduce the burden of gambling addiction on these populations.

Our projections show that several non-legalized states have the demographic capacity to become major contributors to the national gambling market if sports betting were to be approved. In our analysis, we found that states such as California, Texas, Florida, and Georgia are expected to generate more revenue than most established states due to their large populations, sizable young-adult demographics, and substantial urban centers. This analysis shows how expanding sports gambling to just a handful of these large states could dramatically reshape the national market, potentially increasing the industry’s size by billions of dollars. At the same time, the states with more modest projected markets tend to be smaller, more rural, or have demographic profiles associated with lower gambling participation. While these estimates cannot fully capture behavioral or cultural differences across states, they provide a data-driven view of how rapidly the sports gambling industry could grow and which populations may be most vulnerable to associated harms if gambling becomes more widely accessible.

**Limitations**

Some states that have legalized sports gambling were not included in our model because the data automatically excluded certain states, such as Florida and New Mexico. These states have specific policies that alter the reporting of gambling revenue, and our data source did not collect these. This led to a reduced sample size and may affect the accuracy of our projected model.
